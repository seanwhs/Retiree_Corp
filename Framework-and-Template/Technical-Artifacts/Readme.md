## 🚀 How to Utilize this Archive

1.  **Reference:** Use these templates to jump-start new projects without the "blank page" fatigue.
2.  **Clone:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-collective/technical-artifacts.git](https://github.com/your-collective/technical-artifacts.git)
    ```
3.  **Refine:** If you discover a more elegant way to document a system, update the template. We prioritize "evergreen" documentation that stands the test of time.

## 🤝 Guiding Principles
We contribute to this archive not to stay busy, but to stay **sharp**. Every template added should:
* **Reduce Noise:** Strip away unnecessary technical complexity.
* **Empower Others:** Be clear enough to be understood without a phone call.
* **Respect the Margin:** Help us complete technical tasks efficiently so we can return to our friends, health, and leisure.
