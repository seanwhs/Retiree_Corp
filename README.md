## 6. Membership, Partnership, and Trust

Members, partners, and collaborators are individuals of integrity who share our values and fit seamlessly into our culture. We are selective by design; alignment matters more than scale, speed, or opportunity. Character, judgment, and mutual respect are as important as professional capability.

Members and partners are expected to:

* Act with honesty, accountability, and ethical clarity
* Respect the rhythms, boundaries, and well-being of others
* Communicate thoughtfully and directly
* Honor commitments while recognizing human limits
* Uphold confidentiality, trust, and professional discretion

Trust is earned through consistent behavior, shared values, and genuine care for the whole person—not just the work. Each member’s reputation reflects on the community as a whole.

Our culture is founded on mutual support, mentorship, and quiet excellence. We collaborate generously, challenge respectfully, and prioritize group integrity over individual gain.
